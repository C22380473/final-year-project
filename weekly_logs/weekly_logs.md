## Week 4 

**Work Completed:**
- Finalised proposal draft, including Deliverables, Project Schedule and Conclusion sections.  
- Conducted additional research into existing solutions.  
- Contacted the coordination and guidance lecturer for advice on project scope - initial feedback helped clarify the project direction.  
- Proofread the entire proposal.  

**Meetings / Discussions:**
- Email discussion with the coordination and guidance lecturer regarding project scope.  

**Plans for Next Week:**
- Submit the final proposal.  
- Begin wireframe sketches and system diagrams.  
- Plan research tasks for the requirements gathering phase.

## Week 5 

**Work Completed:**
 
- Began the feasibility study for the project, analysing the technical, operational, and resource aspects.
- Met with my supervisor to discuss the completed project proposal draft.
- Talked through user requirements, project scope, and complexity and established a plan to meet weekly for progress updates.
- Created an initial set of functional and non-functional requirements to define system expectations and constraints.

**Meetings / Discussions:**
- Meeting with supervisor to review project progress, feasibility and requirements.

**Plans for Next Week:**
- Continue developing the feasibility study, focusing on refining requirements and validating assumptions.
- Begin working on use cases and system analysis to outline interactions and system behaviour.
- Start drafting initial design diagrams if time allows.



## Week 6

**Work Completed:**

- Met with my supervisor to present the functional and non-functional requirements developed for the project.
- Outlined the key features that will be represented in the upcoming wireframes.
- Discussed the importance of finalising the core functionality of the app to ensure clarity and consistency in development.
- Talked about the technology stack, potential additional features and explored existing solutions for comparison.
- Proposed conducting a tech stack review to confirm suitability and alignment with project goals.
- Scheduled a follow-up meeting for next week to review the wireframes and ensure all newly added requirements are properly reflected in the project report.
- Updated the project report with the latest requirements and discussion points.

**Meetings/Discussions:**

- Meeting with supervisor to review requirements, discuss the tech stack, and plan next steps for wireframes and report updates.

**Plans for Next Week:**

- Show the wireframes to visually represent the system’s structure and user interactions.
- Continue refining the requirements and incorporate supervisor feedback.
- Begin working on the interim report, integrating sections such as system analysis and feasibility findings.
- Start the literature review section of the report to provide background and theoretical context for the project.
- Begin preliminary exploration of the system implementation phase.





## Week 7

**Work Completed:**

- Completed the literature review section of the report, focusing on existing APIs and tools for implementing key app features such as the tuner, metronome and song chord finder.
- Selected two main literature topics to explore in greater depth: Self-Regulated Learning (SRL) and Gamification then analysed their relevance to the project’s objectives and user engagement strategies.
- Expanded Section 3 of the report, adding more detail to the requirements elicitation process by incorporating findings from end-user research and informal digital ethnography.
- Created the initial requirements specification to clearly define the system’s core functions and constraints.
- Completed and added wireframes to Section 4, visually outlining the app’s layout and user interaction flow.
- Met with the supervisor to discuss progress, reviewed the wireframes and received feedback on enabling the viewing of public user profile statistics.
- Discussed the song chord finder feature, with advice to research existing solutions and code implementations focusing on understanding their complexity, background, development origins, functionality, and timing challenges.

**Meetings/Discussions:**

- Supervisor Meeting: Reviewed completed literature review and report updates. Walked through the wireframes and discussed feature feedback. Supervisor advised researching existing chord finder tools and explaining their underlying technical aspects in the report.

**Plans for Next Week:**

- Present progress updates to the supervisor and demonstrate improvements made based on feedback.
- Clarify remaining requirements and refine Section 3 for completeness.
- Begin drafting use cases and developing the UML system diagram to represent system structure and interactions.
- Start Section 4, focusing on system design elements and implementation planning.
